Hi! My name is Arvid. I'm interested in all things omics, with a focus on genetics.

I'm a research assistant at [KI Psychiatrics Genomics institute](https://ki.se/en/meb/ki-psychiatric-genomics-institute), working with [Lu Yi](https://staff.ki.se/people/lu-yi). My work focuses on dissecting the heterogeneity of Major Depression (MD) using genomics and epidemiological data.
